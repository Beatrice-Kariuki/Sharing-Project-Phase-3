# Patient Treatment Classification


The project aims to leverage a comprehensive dataset containing various hematologic parameters such as haematocrit, haemoglobin, erythrocyte count, leucocyte count, thrombocyte count, MCH, MCHC, and MCV to develop machine learning models for classifying patients as either requiring in-patient or out-patient care. The dataset utilized in this study represents electronic health records collected from a private hospital in Indonesia. The project targets the healthcare sector;specifically, in planning and resource allocation for clinics and hospitals, where accurate classification of patients is crucial for optimizing staffing operations, ward capacity management as well as providing optimal medical care to patients.

## Business Problem

Healthcare providers often encounter challenges in efficiently classifying patients based on their care needs, particularly when relying solely on manual assessments of laboratory test results. The lack of a streamlined process for determining whether a patient requires inpatient or outpatient care poses a significant hurdle in optimizing resource allocation and enhancing operational efficiency within medical facilities.
In the dynamic healthcare landscape, VitaHealth-254 seeks to apply machine learning and AI to redefine patient management by empowering healthcare providers with data-driven tools that facilitate informed decision-making.
Envision a patient named Sarah, whose test results indicate the need for medical attention. However, Sarah's healthcare provider faces challenges in accurately determining the appropriate level of care based on the provided data alone.
Through Sarah's journey in navigating patient care classifications, VitaHealth-254 aims to revolutionize the patient experience by providing healthcare professionals with predictive tools that optimize resource allocation and enhance operational efficiency.
## Business Objectives

1.Improve Patient Care Classification:Develop a model that automates the process of categorizing patients based on their laboratory test results to ensure timely and appropriate treatment.Develop machine learning models to identify and quantify the influence of various hematologic parameters (e.g., haematocrit, haemoglobin, erythrocyte count) on the classification of patients

2.Optimize Resource Allocation:By accurately predicting patient classifications, optimize resource allocation within the hospital, including beds, staffing, and other medical resources.Ensure that the right resources are available to meet the needs of different patient categories, leading to improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness in resource utilization.
